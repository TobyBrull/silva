# Silva

Silva is Latin for "forest".

Silva is imagined to be language-oriented programming language or, equivalently, an ecosystem or
library of related programming languages.

The Seed language describes the grammar of another language. A program in the Seed language can be
automatically turned into a parser. A parser generated from a Seed program is represented by the
type `silva::parse_root_t`.

The Fern language is akin to JSON. It is described by the following Seed program
`silva::fern_seed_source_code` (in file fern.hpp).
