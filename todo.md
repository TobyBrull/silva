    * check Seed program when constructing parse_root_t

* context:
    * logging
    * testing

* various:
    * output_buffer_t / string_output_buffer_t
    * allow partial parse (return number of tokens consumed)
    * refactor parse_tree_t and error_tree_t?
        * factor out tree_top_down_t and tree_bottom_up_t?
        * unify the two into a single tree type?

* code review
